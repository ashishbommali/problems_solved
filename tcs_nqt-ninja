PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Among these, Varahamitra was an astrologer of eminence and his book Brihat Jataka is a reckond
as the ultimate authority in astrology. He was once talking with Amarasimha, another gem among 
the nava ratnas and the author of Sanskrit thesaurus, Amarakosha. Amarasimha wanted to know the
final position of person, who starts from the origin 0 0 and travels per following scheme.

He first turns right and travels 10 units of distance.
His second turn is upward for 20 units.
Third turn is to the left for 30 units.
Fourth is downwards for 40 units.
Fifth turn is to the right (again) for 50 units.
... and thus he travels, every time increasing the travel distance by 10 units.

While Varahamihira could use his astrology skills to predict movement based on plam=netray positions
, use your programming expertise to print the final position, given the number of turns (n):
2<=n<=1000

INPUT-1: 3
EXPECTED OUTPUT: -20 20
INPUT-2: 4
EXPECTED OTPUT: -20 -20

SOLUTION: #python_code

n=int(input())
d=10
x_count=0 
y_count=0 
x=0 
y=0 
for i in range(1,n+1):
    if i%2!=0:
        if x_count<1:
            x+=d 
            x_count=1 
        else:
            x-=d 
            x_count=0
    else:
        if y_count<1:
            y+=d 
            y_count=1 
        else:
            y-=d 
            y_count=0
    d+=10
print(x,y)
